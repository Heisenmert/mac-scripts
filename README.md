# mac-scripts
Hello and welcome. You can find some useful scripts for Macadmins.

# mac-monitoring 
A script that saves various performance metrics on macs locally, as csv. If you wish, you can report these data to SQL and visualize.

# captive-portal-access
This is a script created to provide internet access via captive portal in environments with always on proxy. Removes proxies for a certain time and checks internet access. If the end user is connected during the time, it adds back the proxy definition. If it falls to the timeout, it adds in the same way.

# scripts-for-virtual-macs
We use this script for mac virtualization but it can also be used for physical macs. The script examines the idle state of the Mac. If there is someone already logged in, exit will be 0. If no one is logged in, it checks the date the Mac was last logged in. Automatically resets machines that have been idle for 30 days.

# other-mac-scripts
Some other useful and simple scripts for OS friendly name, bypass proxy, Google Chrome autoupdate disable etc.

Enjoy!
